LandOfAmaral3D - By Jacob Amaral
================================

A 3D game I created using the jMonkey engine in Java during the summer of 2014. This game was not meant to be released, just a practice to get me started in game development. I have learned a lot during the course of this project which will help me in the future. Thanks to the jMonkey community for helping me fix a lot of bugs and to Spencer C and Aras for the models in my game. Next up, Unreal Engine :D
